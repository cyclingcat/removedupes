<li><a name="0.2.2">version 0.2.2</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Toolbar button: Added a side-menu for quick-selecting comparison criteria.
    <li>Toolbar button: Button now appears in Seamonkey (well, trunk versions, anyway; I'm having trouble with the 1.1.x versions - help is appreciated).
    <li>Review Dialog: Criteria used in the comparison are now emboldened.
    <li>Review Dialog: Fixed some sorting and sort column indicator issues.
    <li>Review Dialog: You can now include the Message ID and the flags fields as displayed columns.
    <li>Can now use the message status flags as a comparison criteria (read/unread, starred/unstarred, etc.)
    <li>Fixed some locale mis-installation issues (pl-PL with Thunderbird, many locales with Seamonkey release).
    <li>Added pt-BR, he-IL, ru-RU locales; thanks to the Babelzilla translators.
  </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="0.2.1">version 0.2.1</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Review Dialog: Click behavior fixed.
  </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="0.2">version 0.2</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Separate-thread work has proven to be somewhat flaky, especially combined with user activity during search, and double-especially combined with work on IMAP folders. So it is out again in this version.
    <li>Messages can now be compared by their bodies, but this comparison is 'rough' and may not work well with multi-part and/or multibyte-character-set messages.
    <li>The extension now works more properly with IMAP and folders, not ignoring subfolders for which headers have not yet been downloaded.
    <li>There is now a button, a Tools menu item, and a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D) for removing duplicates.
    <li>Review Dialog: The click behavior has changed: Single-click in the checkbox de/selects the message for deletion, single click elsewhere displays the message in the main Thunderbird/MailNews window, and double-click does nothing special.
    <li>Review dialog 'cosmetic' improvements: The sort order is now indicated, and various choices are now persisted (dialog size, sort order, columns being hidden, etc.).
    <li>Review Dialog: 'Last Copy' button added in addition to 'First Copy'.
    <li>Other minor bug fixes.
  </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="0.1.5">version 0.1.5</a>
  <ul>
    <li>The search for duplicates is now done in a separate thread than the main UI thread, so you can continue reading messages or doing other work while searching for dupes.
    <li>Seamonkey: Messages no longer fail to display in the 3-pane window when you click their line in the review dialog.
    <li>Locales now maintained by the kind <a href="www.babelzilla.org">BabelZilla</a> contributors - see <a href="http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&Itemid=88&extension=2543&type=lang">removedupes' page</a> there for a list of locales (we now have Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Slovak, Portugese, Italian, French, Netherlands Dutch and maybe some more).
    <li>Tweaked review dialog mouse click behavior.
    <li>Now informing the user that we're searching for dupes, using the status bar, while s/he is waiting.
    <li>Move to different folder fixed! Can now move dupes to any folder you like; your move target preference is also preserved across uses.
    <li>(Hopefully) No longer trying to search for dupes in non-mail folders (e.g. newsgroups)
    <li>Can now compare messages by their recipient and CC lists.
    <li>Can now sort the dupe sets in the review dialog by the various columns.
  </ul>
</li>


<li><a name="0.1.4">version 0.1.4</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Completely reworked dupe finding algorithm, with x4 and better performance boost:<br>This version processes ~45,000 messages in 50 folders with ~2800 dupes in ~10 seconds (+ ~5.5 seconds for constructing the review and confirmation dialog).
    <li>Added a sunflower field logo.
    <li>Non-ASCII headers (author, subject) are now handled and displayed properly.
    <li>The review & confirmation dialog now shows the number of total dupes, dupe sets, and dupes to be kept.
    <li>The review & confirmation dialog now has a folder picker for selecting a target folder other than the trash - but, alas, it is not yet working; an alternate folder can be used only by manually editing the hidden pref <code>removedupes.mail.default_target_folder</code>.
    <li>When single-clicking a message line in the review & confirmation dialog, the message comes up in the main (3-pane) window (this doesn't work in Seamonkey for some reason, though).
    <li>German (de-DE) localization, thanks to <code>AlfonsName [at] netscape.net</code> and the denizens of <code>#mozilla.de@irc.mozilla.org</code>.
    <li>A message's folder can now also be used as one of the comparison criteria (e.g. to prevent detecting messages from different folders as dupes).
    <li>A message's folder can now also be used as one of the comparison criteria.
    <li>The mechanism for deciding which special folders (Inbox, Trash etc.) to include in a search for dupes has been revamped. It is now controlled by the hidden preference <code>removedupes.mail.allowed_special_folders</code>.
  </ul>
</li>

<li><a name="0.1.3">version 0.1.3</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Added suiterunner support.
    <li>Can now view messages by clicking their lines in the dupes dialog.
    <li>Compatibile with TB 2.0.
    <li>Partial solution for the problem of non-ASCII message subject and author name.
  </ul>
</li>

<li><a name="0.1.2">version 0.1.2</a>
  <ul>
    <li>First release version.
  </ul>
